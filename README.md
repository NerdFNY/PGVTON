# PGVTON â€” Official Implementation
Hi,this is our new work about virtual try-on: PG-VTON. 

This paper has been published on TMM.

Sorry, I am going to graduate, there are too many important things needed to do for me.

After everything is ok, I will clear up this code and release it as soon as possible.
